		<h4>Hello, My name is Michael Meding</h4>
		<p>or just Mike for short. I'm a Computer Science major at UMass Lowell and enjoy many disciplines of programming including web-coding. </p>
		<h4>Hobbies?</h4>
		<p>In my spare time I am an avid cyclist often riding hundreds of miles a week. If I'm not in front of my PC I'm lost somewhere out on a ride.</p>
		<p>In addition to cycling, I also play around with an firmware based coding such as the arduino.</p>
		<h4>Little arduino project I did</h4>

		<h4>How did you get started?</h4>
		<p>I really got interested in programming when I started working at this company called Outsmart. When I started I was working on the product
			assembly line churning out little plastic devices all day. Luckily, as production started to slow down I was moved to writing small scripts to 
			automate some of the manufacturing tests/processes. From there it was a downward spiral until I was drinking 5 cups of coffee a day and churning
			out thousands upon thousands of lines of enterprise code.</p>
