		<h4>Hello, My name is Michael Meding</h4>
		<p>or just Mike for short. I'm a Computer Science major at UMass Lowell and enjoy many disciplines of programming including web-coding. </p>
		<h4>Why did I choose this class?</h4>
		<p>I wanted to take programming class where I could express myself. I program in Java and C every day and yet I find a certain elegance
			in the unbound nature of front end web programming. </p>
