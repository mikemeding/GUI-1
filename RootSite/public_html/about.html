This file is just a description of myself and some links

Additionally, I used twitter bootstrap for my CSS as it makes for a quick and decent looking
website without too much hassle. There are also some other JS files which include
the rest of the fancy bootstrap dynamic stuff. Using bootstrap also maintains
uniformity across all browsers which is a major plus, although less important 
for this first simple site.

					<h4>Hello, My name is Michael Meding</h4>
					<p>or just Mike for short. I'm a Computer Science major at UMass Lowell and enjoy many disciplines of programming including web-coding. </p>
					<h4>Hobbies?</h4>
					<p>In my spare time I am an avid cyclist often riding hundreds of miles a week. If I'm not in front of my PC I'm lost somewhere out on a ride.</p>
					<h4>How did you get started?</h4>
					<p>I really got interested in programming when I started working at this company called Outsmart. When I started I was working on the product
					assembly line churning out little plastic devices all day. Luckily, as production started to slow down I was moved to writing small scripts to 
					automate some of the manufacturing tests/processes. From there it was a downward spiral until I was drinking 5 cups of coffee a day and churning
					out thousands upon thousands of lines of enterprise code.</p>
					<h4>Interesting things,</h4>
